- __guides__
- This page provides the user with 4 options on the areas of the game that we cover. I displayed the diffrent options in 4 seperate boxes that have images to also help visualise the differences.
- I also added dropdown menus to better display the different setcions within the 4 options on the page. It makes the page easier to navigate and cleans the visuals of the page.

## Design
- I used the colors black, gold, green and purple as they best represent the mood and color scheme of the game.
- The background image used on all pages is the main cover of the game and helps users identify what the site is based on.

## User Experince

###  First Time Users Goal
- New users should get famillar with the layout of the website and learn how to navigate it.
- A new user would want to learn more information on each page of the website and what they offer.

### Returning User Experince
- A returning user should be able to navigate the website easily to find the information they are looking for.
