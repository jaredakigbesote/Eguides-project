## Features

- __Navigation bar__
- The nav bar is designed to help users with smaller screens navigate our site easier by using a reponsive dropdown menu. It contains options for all 4 sections of the website.
- Users on larger screens, the nav bar will show the 4 options out along the header.
- __Home Page__
- The home page provides the user with information on the website and a brief overview of the game with a video of the game trailer.
- The bottom section of the page provides information on how the website helps players and what we offer to people when they sign up.
- __guides__
- This page provides the user with 4 options on the areas of the game that we cover. I displayed the diffrent options in 4 seperate boxes that have images to also help visualise the differences.
- I also added dropdown menus to better display the different setcions within the 4 options on the page. It makes the page easier to navigate and cleans the visuals of the page.

- Designed the same as the guides page to help keep a design standard across the site.
- This page allows the users to engage with the tools and guides avaliable to them.
